### How to run tests ###
Run the latest available development build. Look at patches to test against for desired results.

### Deployment instructions ###

### Contribution guidelines ###
See: http://93.104.208.32/root/ToontownWorldOnline/blob/feature/2.4.9/CONTRIBUTING.md

### Writing tests ###
Commits will be made in the **Branch** - features that are new or **VERY** **unstable** will go in a **new** Branch titled "feature/" "tweak/" "fix/" "bugfix/" (etc) followed by the feature name.

### Code review ###
Once changes to the source code have been applied they will go into  a **new** branch titled "feature/" "tweak/" "fix/" "bugfix/" (etc) followed by the feature name and will be deployed to a test server (see instructions above). 

When the code gets in a more stable state it can be moved to the patch/release **branch** where the Community Managers can freely test.

### Other guidelines ###
Commits **MUST NOT BE MADE** **directly** to the **master Branch**. Features that are new or **VERY** **unstable** will go in a **new** Branch titled "feature/" "tweak/" "fix/" "bugfix/" (etc) followed by the name to briefly explain. If the code gets in a more stable state it can be moved into the release/patch branch where the Community Managers can freely test.

Once the Community Managers are happy and it has been tested multiple times it **can** be moved to the **patch/release**  branch at a scheduled release. The patch/release branch can then be merged into the **master** Branch.

The Developer(s) must include notes in each commit to help understand changes and must write a changelog to give to the Community Managers so they can make a news release about it. 

Changes will be bulked together in a release.
If there is an **EMERGENCY bug fix** that is breaking or **hindering performance** of the game it may be necessary to speed up the developing and testing process - if that cannot happen (not enough time - issue** too severe**) it will be quickly **released** to **release/patch branch**
